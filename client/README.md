Do all the development work in the development directory. DO NOT make any changes in the default directory.

To develop locally, run

    grunt server

It will automatically load index.html file in the browser and reload if anything changed.

When you are happy, run

    grunt

to generate file for distribution and they will be copied to the default directory.
